# Razor Pages With HTMX

A prototype ASP.NET Core Razor Pages application whose create, read, update, delete and list operations are made
interactive with [HTMX](https://htmx.org/). Built as the worked example for a presentation on enhancing Razor Pages
with HTMX, and kept small enough to read on a screen.

- `src/HTMX Pages Solution.slnx` — the solution: the application in `src/HTMX.Application.Web/`, its unit tests in
  `src/HTMX.Test.Unit/`.
- `CLAUDE.md` — the working agreement for AI coding sessions in this repository.
- `src/.editorconfig` — the house C# style, a verbatim copy of the one in [Signalbox](https://github.com/mattonweb/Signalbox).

## Running it

```bash
dotnet run --project src/HTMX.Application.Web --launch-profile http
```

Then open <http://localhost:5049>. The tests run with `dotnet test "src/HTMX Pages Solution.slnx"`.

## Versions and choices

- **.NET 10** (SDK 10.0.402) and **C# 14**.
- **Persistence: Entity Framework Core 10.0.14 over SQLite, in memory.** The database is created when the application
  starts and filled from seed data written in C#; it disappears when the application stops. Nothing is written to
  disk, so a clone needs no setup, and every run starts from the same known data. Restarting the application resets
  the demo.
- **Tests:** MSTest 4.5.2.
- **HTMX:** not added yet; its exact version is pinned and recorded here when it is.
